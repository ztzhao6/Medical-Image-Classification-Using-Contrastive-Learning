# Unsupervised Contrastive Learning of Radiomics and Deep Features for Label-Efficient Tumor Classification
To solve CNNs' poor MVI predictive ability caused by tumor heterogeneity and inadequate labeled image data, a self-supervised pretext task, namely "Radiomics-Deep Feature Correspondence", is proposed.
The experiments show that the performance of fine-tuning the pre-trained CNN (i) is superior to that of the CNN trained from scratch; and (ii) reach an similar performance to that of the train-from-scratch CNN by far fewer labeled training data.
